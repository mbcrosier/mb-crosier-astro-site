# Resources for Moving from Consulting to a Startup

Lots of people have written amazing resources on how to move from consulting into a startup role, as well as how to navigate important but often opaque topics like equity or reverse interviewing.

This is a compilation of some of my favorite resources that I found & used during my job search. That said, the startup landscape is constantly evolving, so this list is too! Let me know if there are resources I should add.

## Start Here (Good Overviews)

- [The Ultimate Guide to Finding a Startup Job](https://www.vinayiyengar.com/job-guide/) - Very tactical guide on how to identify and reach out to startups, questions to ask to diligence startupsâ€™ prospects, and how to think about comp
- [How to Make the Leap from Consulting to a Startup](https://medium.com/future-vision/how-to-make-the-leap-from-consulting-to-a-startup-ee02fd80dbf7) - Guide by ex-Bainie Julia DeWahl (early at Opendoor). Covers learning about startups, interviewing and assessing them, and how to succeed on the job

## Places to Look for Roles

### Job Boards

- [Ali Rohde Jobs](https://alirohdejobs.substack.com/): Ops/CoS/Generalist/VC
- [Extant Jobs](https://extantjobs.substack.com/): Ops/CoS/Generalist/VC
- [Chief of Staff network](https://www.chiefofstaff.network/jobs): Chief of Staff/Ops
- [Lennyâ€™s Job Board](https://www.lennysjobs.com/): PM-specific

### VC/Accelerator Job Listings

- [YCâ€™s Work at a Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/)
- Most accelerators maintain some sort of â€˜Jobsâ€™ page where you can search roles within their network; that said, if you know a VC who you can ask directly about promising portfolio companies / jobs in their network, thatâ€™s even better ðŸ™‚

### Recruiters (ex-consulting specific)

- [Golden Gate](https://www.goldengaterecruits.com/) - Really great team of ex-Bainies. Lots of helpful resources on their site as well.
- [Omna Search](https://www.omnasearch.com/) - Bigger than Golden Gate, ex-McKinsey founders. Havenâ€™t worked with them personally, but seem to have good reach.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Remember**: [60-80%] of jobs are never listed. Job boards are great, but using your network (or pitching yourself for your dream role that doesnâ€™t exist yet!) is better. See the initial guides for tips on how to do that.

</aside>

## On Chief of Staff Roles, Specifically

- [The Chief of Staff role in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/chiefofstaffnetwork/the-chief-of-staff-role-in-silicon-valley-182eb93e636e): By Julia DeWahl, again ðŸ™‚. Overview of the role and FAQs for candidates/executives.
- [Donâ€™t Hire a Chief of Staff](https://nmoryl.com/dont-hire-a-chief-of-staff-b65c16d56eac): For contrast with Juliaâ€™s take.

## Evaluating a Company

- [Reverse Interviewing](https://www.reforge.com/blog/reverse-interview): Your questions are the last impression you leave an interviewer with. This article has good tips for how to come prepared to make sure the role & team would set you up for success (and set yourself apart in the process).
- [What To Ask in Interviews](https://posthog.com/founders/what-to-ask-in-interviews): Startups are risky. You can, and should, ask about PMF, Revenue/ARR, Runway. These questions impact your job stability, ask them upfront!
- [Tactical Company Building Lessons: Ask These Questions before Joining](https://review.firstround.com/23-tactical-company-building-lessons-learned-from-scaling-stripe-and-notion#3-ask-these-questions-before-joining-a-startup): TL;DR, do you believe in the founders and their passion/vision?
- [Also ask about comp upfront to set expectations & safe yourself - and them - time if expectations are misaligned]

## Comp + Equity

### Comp

- Several of the previously shared resources include compensation resources - specifically [Omna](https://www.omnasearch.com/2022-startup-compensation-guide), [Golden Gate](https://goldengaterecruits.substack.com/), and [Vinay Ingeyar](https://www.vinayiyengar.com/job-guide/) (via OptionImpact)
    - Other websites like [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) and Glassdoor put out some comp data for free, but coverage of Ops / CoS type jobs varies

### Equity

- [Equity for Software Engineers](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/equity-for-software-engineers/): Super comprehensive, and engineers arenâ€™t the only ones who need this info!
- [Stripeâ€™s Equity Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/equity-for-employees): While this is written for founders, itâ€™s clearly written and a helpful guide for heuristics (e.g. equity %s to grant by role) as well as to understand second-level concepts like ISOs vs. NSOs. Maybe not necessary upfront, but helpful down the line.

## Succeeding Once You're There
- [How to Make the Leap from Consulting to a Startup](https://medium.com/future-vision/how-to-make-the-leap-from-consulting-to-a-startup-ee02fd80dbf7): Yes, I linked this at the top also, but it has great content on this topic! 
- [Tactical Company Building Lessons: Taking Charge of Your Startup Career](https://review.firstround.com/23-tactical-company-building-lessons-learned-from-scaling-stripe-and-notion#taking-charge-of-your-startup-career): Another repeat, but also contains good tactical advice around leaning into the product and filling gaps on the job
