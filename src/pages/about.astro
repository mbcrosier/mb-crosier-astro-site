  <p>Hi, I'm MB. ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>I'm currently a Growth Marketer at <a href="https://www.stytch.com" target="_blank">Stytch</a>, a developer tools startup. Previously, I worked as a consultant at Bain & Co., and as an extern on the Strategy team at Codecademy.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy running, reading, scuba diving, playing NYT Games, watching UVA basketball, and trying new restaurants.</p>
  <p>I also volunteer as a docent and tour guide at the <a href="https://merchantshouse.org" target="_blank">Merchant's House Museum</a>. Previously, I gave tours in Charlottesville with UVA's <a href="https://www.uvaguides.org/" target="_blank">University Guide Service</a>, and of Boston's Freedom Trail with <a href="https://bostonbyfoot.org/" target="_blank">Boston by Foot.</a></p>
